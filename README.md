# Estimation-of-the-Charge-Carrier-Density-of-Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides

•The reports demonstrate for the first time, the experimental determination of electronic properties and the pristine band structure for the family of TMDs materials (MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , SnSe 2 , MoSe 2 , SnS, NiSe 2 ) using sophisticated Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) technique. 

•Further, utilizing the hall effect measurements, effective masses have been experimentally approximated and utilized for estimating the carrier concentration for all pristine TMDs. 

•Successful demonstration of the experimental extraction of the electronic properties of all TMDs would provide a detailed understanding of the band structures and further band alignment and to develop more optimized 2D TMDs based electronic and optoelectronic devices.
